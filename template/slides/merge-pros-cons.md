## Merge

| Cons | Pros |
|---|---|
| Adds merge commit causing unneeded pollution if merging master in multiple times. | Simple and easy when no conflicts arise |
|Can cause non-linear history on feature branch, making it difficult to merge in the future when conflicts arise, and making it difficult to follow true history | Keeps merge context|
