## Shipped but never done

- Build something and ship it. That’s the start. 10% of lifetime effort?
- Maintain it. Fix it. Enhance it. 90% of lifetime effort? Hopefully!

Therefor the Resulting Rules:
- Code it as if you’ll forget you ever did it, which you likely will.
- Do not write code in a way that you’d be frustrated if it you had to maintain it.
