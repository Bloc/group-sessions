## This Lecture Is Almost Shipped.

- Ship. You get great by shipping a lot of code.
- Correct is the only goal as you start. Add complete, concise and clarity as you go.
- Get help fast. Your ego, that I do not need help self-talk, is wrong. Shipping is the goal! Humility.
- Opinions are abundant on this and every other topic. But if you ship, you are doing it well. If you do not ship, everything is suspect.
