## This Lecture Is Shipped. Time to evolve.

- Ship. You get great by shipping a lot of code.
- Correct is the only goal as you start. Add complete, concise and clarity as you go.
- Get help fast. Your ego, that I don't need help self-talk, is wrong. Shipping is the goal!
- Opinions are abundant on this and every other topic. If you ship, you’re doing it well. If you don’t ship, everything is suspect.
