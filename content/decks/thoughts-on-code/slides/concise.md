## Concise

- Less is more. This takes time take to achieve and is not the goal as you start.
- Fewer lines of code. Use built-in methods, they are significantly faster.
- Use open source code. You do not have enough time in your entire life to duplicate this.
- Careful names for variables, methods, objects.
