## The Physiology of Frustration

- Information from the environment - it's not shipped.
- Reaction to information - judgement about self.
- Stress generates chemistry and then cortisol flows.
- Cortisol eliminates nuance.
- Nuance is where the issue is.
- You've just hidden the issue from your vision. Not useful!
